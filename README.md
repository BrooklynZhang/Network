# Network Simulator

## Tools
Python 3+

SimPy
 
## Introduction
This network simulator is used to test the multi-path routing of the 5G access network. 
Users can configure UEs, IABs, IAB Donor and links to simulate the network environment they need.


## Architecture
The link has the functions of delay and transmission time and bandwidth limitation.
Users can choose different routing algorithms to test the efficiency of the algorithm.


## Configuration
IAB Donor:

IAB

Routers

UEs

Flows


TBU
